Alright so i dont know whats been going on with argos but somehow its spread, The Ransomware was a joke, you can call it a penetest. i thought nothing about it.
BUT STILL, someone decided to spread it using exploits and manipulation. Ive been offline alot i know but ive been working on my own protection engine for others.
TeraEng will be release in like a few months or so. but PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. DONT SPREAD MY STUFF.

Here are the decryption keys:
A.variant: diguyh3rtiu34gth9iu34tg398uhfb08uhd0sdfgoigiohgi98guh3459tiu34ht8hdfv087yr
B.variant (If youi somehow got it): 23o5j23op6i2h56oij254h62opij6h25pi6uhtyhg09h43534+098u340oiuh640iuh43598uh46ib456

the decryptor has a chance of crashing depending on how good your computer is or how many files you have.

Stay safe everyone!
